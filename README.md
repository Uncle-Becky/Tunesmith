Crafting ideas into lyrics and melody while learning effectively  

Song Crafting Application Introduction


This repository contains the code for a song crafting application that uses OpenAI's API to generate lyrics and melodies for songs. The application is still under development, but it is already capable of generating high-quality lyrics and melodies.

The application is designed to be used by songwriters, musicians, and anyone else who wants to create songs. It is easy to use and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the user.

Features


The application has the following features:

1. Lyric Generation: The application can generate lyrics for a song based on a title and a few keywords. The lyrics can be customized to fit the specific needs of the user, such as the genre of music, the length of the song, and the style of the lyrics.

2. Melody Generation: The application can generate melodies for a song based on a title, chords, and lyrics. The melodies can also be customized to fit the specific needs of the user.

3. User Customization: The application can be customized to fit the specific needs of the user. For example, the user can choose the type of music that the application generates, the length of the song, and the style of the lyrics and melodies.

Getting Started


To get started with the application, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip
- OpenAI's API

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can clone the repository and install the application:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/song-crafting-app.git
cd song-crafting-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```shell
python main.py
```

Usage


The application is easy to use. To generate lyrics, simply provide the application with a title and a few keywords. For example, to generate lyrics for a song with the title "The Love Song", you would use the following command:

```shell
python main.py --title "The Love Song" --keywords "love, romance, heartbreak"
```

The application will then generate a set of lyrics for the song.

To generate melodies, provide the application with a title, chords, and lyrics. For example, to generate melodies for a song with the title "The Love Song", you would use the following command:

```shell
python main.py --title "The Love Song" --keywords "love, romance, heartbreak" --chords "G, C, D, Em"
```

The application will then generate a set of melodies for the song.
